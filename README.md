## Using Docker
This docker image is designed to be used with Docker Swarm and as such it uses Docker Secrets for passing in configuration.

### Building the Image
The docker image is built using a jar version that has been uploaded to the CIDA artifactory. The artifact version needs to be provided as follows:
```
% docker build --mlr-version=0.1-SNAPSHOT .
```

### Creating the Docker Service
On the docker manager of your swarm you can create the service to run this application by running a command such as (where `mlr_notification` is the name of the built image):
```
docker service create --name mlrnotification --publish 8080:8080 --secret source=mlr_email_config,target=application.yml --env MLR_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM="test@example.com" --env MLR_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TEXT="Hello" --env MLR_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_HOST=localhost --env MLR_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_PORT=25 --env MLR_NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PWD="test"
```
